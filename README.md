## Overview

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out 3 hours and create a a full-stack application to search and view Cameo talent.
We have set up a boilerplate Express backend and a React front-end for you to use.
This is what we use here at Cameo.
If you are more comfortable with another framework or tool, feel free to leverage it.

### Backend

Implement a new endpoint `HTTP GET /search` that accepts a query, and returns a filtered list of talent based on that query. A user should be able to search by `username`, `name`, or `category`.

**Note** A list of Cameo talent is provided in `TALENT_DATA.json`

### Frontend

Implement a search bar where a user can type a query.
It should call your `/search` endpoint when the user presses `Enter` or a `Submit` button.

Render the results of the query in a table.

Implement sorting of the results on the client-side.
A user should be able to sort by `price`, `score`, and `lastActiveAt`.

Implement filtering of the results on the client-side.
A user should be able to filter by `isAvailableForDirectMessage` and `isAvailableForBusinessRequests`.

### Bonus

**If you have time**, implement **ONE** of the following:

- Filter by a range of `price` values.
- Paginate the results of `/search` so it returns 5 results max. Let the client navigate through pages of results.
- Update `/search` to sort results server-side.
- Or anything else that sounds fun to you!

**Hey this is important!**
We hope you can spend about three hours on this project. If you can finish faster â€” great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 3 hours MAX.
